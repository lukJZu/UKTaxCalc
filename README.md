# UKTaxCalc
This app was developed as a training and demonstration of using Qt for Python to build a GUI

The app can be used to calcuate the monthly net salary after income tax and NI for employees on PAYE in the UK.
It can also factor in the different start date than the start of the tax year in April, ie. if the employee only started working in July meaning they will be paying less tax in the year and have different take-home pay in the initial few months.
